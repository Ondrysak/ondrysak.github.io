Summary: What is Docker, what does it do?


Hello fellaz, if u did not hear about Docker before now its the time to change it!

Virtualization is cool, Docker is cool++. Lets list some basic commands you can play around with, I will talk about them more in depth later.

```bash
docker build
docker images 
docker run
docker stop
docker ps
docker rm
docker inspect
docker pull 
docker push
```

Wow, article so long already, dig in documentation for more info.
