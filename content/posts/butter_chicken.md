# Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhani)
Butter Chicken, or Murgh Makhani, stands as one of the most cherished curries in Indian cuisine. This refined recipe outlines the meticulous steps to achieve an exquisite blend of flavors and textures.

## Ingredients 

* 2 pounds (about 900g) boneless, skinless chicken, cut into cubes
* 1 cup plain yogurt
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 1 tablespoon garam masala
* 1 tablespoon ginger, finely grated
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon chili powder
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 onions, finely chopped
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 2 teaspoons minced garlic
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 1 can (14 ounces) crushed tomatoes
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 cup cold butter
* Fresh naans or white basmati rice
* Fresh coriander for garnish (optional)

## Marinating the Chicken and Simulating the Tandoor Experience
Begin by crafting a marinade in a spacious bowl, combining yogurt, minced garlic, lemon juice, garam masala, ginger, salt, and chili powder. Immerse the cubed chicken in this aromatic mixture, ensuring an even coating. Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of one hour.

Preheat the broiler and the marinated chicken on the sheet, crowning it with a touch of butter. Broil with vigilant attention until the chicken achieves a tantalizing char and thorough doneness, approximately 15 minutes. Allow the charred chicken to cool briefly.

## Crafting the Sauce
Meticulously dice two onions and saut√© them in butter until they attain a sumptuous golden brown hue. Introduce a hint of minced garlic and a touch of garam masala, allowing the flavors to harmonize briefly. Incorporate a can of crushed tomatoes and allow the mixture to simmer to perfection. Employ a hand blender to transform this medley into a lusciously smooth sauce, adjusting the seasoning with salt and pepper to achieve an ideal balance.

## Integration of Flavors
Merge the succulent, charred chicken into the meticulously crafted sauce, ensuring the incorporation of any released juices. Stir gently and allow the ensemble to simmer, further enhancing the amalgamation of flavors.

Conclude the culinary symphony by introducing a modest cup of heavy cream and a generous portion of cold butter. Stir until the amalgamation achieves a harmonious, uniform color.

## Presentation
This culinary masterpiece is best accompanied by fresh naans or elegantly steamed white basmati rice. For an aesthetic touch, garnish with fresh coriander, though the absence of this herb does not compromise the dish's excellence. Serve and relish the gastronomic delight that is Butter Chicken.
